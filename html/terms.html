If you are an End User, SoundLine! reserves the right to notify your organization and/or the administrator associated with your account with respect to any violation of these Terms.</p><h2><strong>2 - Your Content</strong></h2><p>End Users may create, process, upload, submit, store, send and receive content in connection with their use of the Services (the “Customer Content”). </p><p>As between Customer and SoundLine!, Customer retains all ownership and intellectual property rights in and to that Customer Content and SoundLine! shall not be responsible for the Customer Content or the way Customer or its End Users choose to use the Services to store or process any Customer Content. </p><p>Subject to these Terms, you (on behalf of yourself and your End Users) hereby grant to SoundLine! a worldwide, limited, non-exclusive and non-transferrable (except in connection with the sale or transfer of its business) license to access, use, copy, reproduce, process, adapt, distribute, publish, transmit, export and display the Customer Content as reasonably necessary (a) to provide, maintain and update the Services; (b) to prevent or address service, security, support and technical issues; (c) as required by law; and (d) as expressly permitted by Customer in writing.</p><h2><strong>3 - Use of Third Party Services in Connection with the</strong> SoundLine! <strong>Services</strong></h2><p>SoundLine! makes various third-party applications and services available for use in connection with the Services (the “Third Party Services”). Your use of such Third Party Services, and any exchange of data between You and the provider of such Third Party Service is solely between you and the third-party service provider. </p><p>SoundLine! does not warrant or support any Third Party Service or other non-SoundLine! product or service, regardless of whether such Third Party Service, is promoted or made available through our Service or is designated by SoundLine! as “certified” or “working with” the SoundLine! Service. </p><p>Customer acknowledges that providers of such Third Party Services may have access to Customer Content in connection with the interoperation and support of such Third Party Services with the Service and that, as between Customer and SoundLine!, Customer is solely responsible for reviewing such Third Party Service provider’s practices and policies to ensure that they meet the legal and business requirements of Customer. </p><p>To the extent Customer authorizes the access or transmission of Customer Content through a Third Party Service, SoundLine! shall not be responsible for any use, disclosure, modification, or deletion of such Customer Content by the Third Party Service provider or for any act or omission on the part of such Third Party Service provider.</p><h2><strong>4 - Fees</strong></h2><p>4.1 Fees.

The number of Imported Captures subscriptions purchased under a subscription cannot be decreased during the applicable term. </p><p>No credits or refunds will be issued for usage that is less than the purchased number of licenses.</p><p>No adjustments are made for unused time on licenses. </p><p>The subscription term for your Imported Captures begins on the date on which you sign up and pay for the Service (the “Subscription Start Date”), regardless of the date on which you provision your individual End User accounts.</p><p>4.2 Auto Renewal. Customer agrees that its subscription to the Services will automatically renew on an annual or monthly basis (the “Renewal Date”) depending on the term chosen by Customer when subscribing to the Service. </p><p>Customer hereby authorizes SoundLine! to automatically charge Customer the applicable fees on or after each such Renewal Date unless Customer’s subscription to the Service has been terminated or cancelled as set forth in Section 5 below.</p><p>4.3 Calculation of Fees. Fees are based on annual or monthly periods that begin on Customer’s Subscription Start Date and end on the annual or monthly anniversary thereof (depending on whether Customer chooses an annual or monthly subscription). </p><p>Customers are required to purchase a subscription for each End User and may add additional End Users to their account at any time by adding licenses through the application or notifying SoundLine! at <a href="mailto:robin@listenup.ai">robin@listenup.ai</a>. SoundLine! reserves the right to review the total number of Imported Captures associated with Customer’s account from time to time and, if the number of Imported Captures exceeds Customer&#x27;s current subscription, then SoundLine! reserves the right, upon notice to Customer, to invoice Customer for any additional Imported Captures on a pro rata basis for the remaining period of Customer’s subscription term. </p><p>SoundLine! reserves the right to revise fees associated with the Service at any time upon not less than twenty (20) days prior notice to Customer, with such revised fees to be applied to Customer upon Customer’s next monthly or annual subscription term (as the case may be) and with respect to any additional Imported Captures added to Customer’s subscription during the then current monthly or annual subscription term. XXX</p><p>4.4 Taxes. All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties or similar assessments of any nature, including for example, value-added, sales, use or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction (collectively “Taxes”). Customer shall be responsible for payment of all such Taxes associated with its purchase of access to the Service, excluding only those taxes that are based on SoundLine!’s net income. Should you be required to withhold any Taxes upon payment to SoundLine!, you will reimburse SoundLine! for such withholding.</p><p>4.5 Trial Subscriptions. SoundLine! may, at its option, offer new customers a limited free trial of the Service, subject to these Terms.

No organization or individual is entitled to receive more than one (1) free trial of the Service.</p><p>4.6 Late Payment. If you fail to make payments (not disputed in good faith) when due under these Terms, and after continued non-payment for a period of fifteen (15) days after we provide you with written notice and an opportunity to cure, we may suspend provision of the Service until payment is received and may charge you a late fee on the overdue amount from the date such amount became due at the lesser rate of 1.5% per month or the maximum rate permitted by applicable law, together with our costs incurred in collecting such payment. We are entitled to withhold performance and suspend provision of the Service until all undisputed amounts due are paid in full.</p><h2><strong>5 - Term and Termination</strong></h2><p>These Terms shall remain in full force and effect until all Customer subscriptions to the Service have expired, have been terminated or are cancelled. Either party may terminate Customer’s subscription to the Service if the other party: (a) is in material breach of these Terms and fails to cure such breach within twenty (20) days following written notice by the non-breaching party; or (b) ceases its business operations or becomes subject to insolvency proceedings and such proceedings are not dismissed within sixty (60) days. Customer may cancel its subscription to the Service by notifying SoundLine! at <a href="mailto:robin@listenup.ai">robin@listenup.ai</a> no later than thirty (30) days prior to the Renewal Date.</p><p>Upon expiration, termination or cancellation of Customer’s subscription, SoundLine! may immediately deactivate Customer’s account; provided, however, that in no event shall any such deactivation relieve Customer of any obligation to pay fees accrued or payable to SoundLine! or of any liability pertaining to Customer’s use of the Service prior to such expiration, termination or cancellation. The following sections shall survive any expiration or termination of these Terms: Sections 7, 8, 10, 13 and 16.</p><h2><strong>6 -</strong> SoundLine!’s <strong>Responsibilities</strong></h2><ol role="list"><li>Providing the Services. SoundLine! will make the Services available to Customer and its End Users as described in these Terms.</li><li>Protecting the Customer Content. SoundLine! will maintain industry-standard administrative, physical, and technical safeguards designed to prevent unauthorized access, use, modification, deletion or disclosure of the Customer Content and will ensure that third-party service providers utilized by SoundLine! in connection with its delivery of the Services do the same.</li></ol><p>If Customer Content includes personal data defined by EU Regulation 2016/679 (the General Data Protection Regulation or “GDPR”), if such Customer Content is transferred outside the European Economic Area or Switzerland to any country not deemed by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for personal data, and/or if Customer Content includes personal information as defined by the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (the “CCPA”), then the terms of the SoundLine! Data Processing Addendum shall apply to such personal data and be incorporated into these Terms upon the execution and submission of the SoundLine! Data Processing Addendum by Customer in accordance with its terms. </p><ol start="3" role="list"><li>Data Portability and Deletion. The European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) provide individuals in certain circumstances with rights to, among other things, access, delete and make corrections to their personal data.

Either party may disclose these Terms to potential parties to a bona fide fundraising, acquisition, or similar transaction solely for the purposes of the proposed transaction, provided that any such potential party is subject to written non-disclosure obligations and limitations on use that are no less protective than those set forth herein.</p><ol start="3" role="list"><li>Equitable Relief. The receiving party acknowledges that the remedy at law for breach of these confidentiality provisions may be inadequate and that, in addition to any other remedy the disclosing party may have, it shall be entitled to seek equitable relief, including, without limitation, an injunction or injunctions (without the requirement of posting a bond, other security or any similar requirement or proving any actual damages), to prevent breaches or threatened breaches of these confidentiality provisions by the receiving party or any of its Representatives and to enforce the terms and provisions of this Section 8 in addition to any other remedy to which the disclosing party is entitled at law or in equity.</li><li>Compelled Disclosure. The receiving party may access and disclose Confidential Information of the disclosing party if legally required to do so in connection with any legal or regulatory proceeding; provided, however, that in such event the receiving party will, if lawfully permitted to do so, provide the disclosing party with notice in a reasonable time prior to such access or disclosure so as to allow the disclosing party an opportunity to seek appropriate protective measures.</li></ol><p>Receiving party will furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required to be disclosed, and any Confidential Information so disclosed shall maintain its confidentiality protection for all purposes other than such legally compelled disclosure. If SoundLine! is compelled by law to access or disclose Customer’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which Customer is a party, Customer will reimburse SoundLine! for the reasonable costs of compiling and providing secure access to such Confidential Information.</p><h2><strong>8 -</strong> SoundLine!’s <strong>Intellectual Property Rights; Rights to Customer Feedback</strong></h2><p>As between SoundLine! and Customer, SoundLine! owns all intellectual property rights in and to the Service (excluding only the Customer Content) and all trademarks, logos and service marks utilized by SoundLine! in connection with the delivery of the Service. </p><p>SoundLine! grants You a non-sublicensable, non-transferrable, non-exclusive, limited license to use the object code version of the Service solely as necessary to use the Service in accordance with these Terms. All rights not expressly granted by this license are hereby retained by SoundLine! and you may not copy, modify, adapt, reproduce, distribute, reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble any aspect of the Service.</p><p>We appreciate and welcome feedback from our customers.

Employees of SoundLine! may work remotely from the European Union and other regions.</p><p>Except as explicitly set forth herein (and in the Data Processing Agreement, if such an agreement is entered into by the parties), SoundLine! makes no representations that the Services are appropriate or available for use in jurisdictions outside of the United States or the European Union.</p><p>Those who access or use the Service from other jurisdictions do so at their own volition and are responsible for compliance with local laws. SoundLine! may offer services in other jurisdictions that are subject to different terms and conditions. In instances where the Customer&#x27;s use of the Service occurs from within such a jurisdiction, the SoundLine! terms and conditions governing that non-U.S. and non-E.U. jurisdiction shall take precedence over any conflicting provisions in these Terms with respect to the Customer&#x27;s use of the Service from within such foreign jurisdiction.</p><p>[Note: Legal advice from a qualified professional specializing in international trade and internet law is strongly recommended to ensure compliance and adequacy of these terms.]</p><h2><strong>13 - Indemnification Obligations</strong></h2><ol role="list"><li>Customer’s Indemnification Obligations.

If SoundLine!, in its sole and reasonable judgment, determines that none of the above options are commercially reasonable, then SoundLine! may suspend or terminate Customer’s use of the Service, in which case SoundLine!’s sole liability (in addition to its indemnification obligations above) shall be to provide Customer with a pro-rated refund of prepaid but unused fees applicable to the remaining portion of Customer’s current subscription term. Subsections (b) above and this subsection (c) state SoundLine!’s sole liability with respect to, and Customer Parties’ exclusive remedy against SoundLine! for, any infringement claim.</p><p>Indemnification Process. The party seeking indemnification shall provide prompt notice to the indemnifying party concerning the existence of an indemnifiable claim and shall promptly provide the indemnifying party with all information and assistance reasonably requested and cooperate fully with the indemnifying party in defending the claim. </p><p>Failure to give prompt notice shall not constitute a waiver of a party’s right to indemnification and shall affect the indemnifying party’s obligations under these Terms only to the extent that the indemnifying party’s rights are materially prejudiced by such failure or delay. The indemnifying party shall have full control and authority over the defense of any claim; provided, however, that any settlement requiring the party seeking indemnification to admit liability or make any financial payment shall require such party’s prior written consent, not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed.</p><h2><strong>14 - Modifications</strong></h2><p>SoundLine! reserves the right to update or modify these Terms from time to time as our business evolves by posting an updated version of these Terms on our website. </p><p>This includes the right to modify the services included on Free Trial.

The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth herein is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the portions of this section mandating arbitration shall be deemed null and void in their entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes. Customer may opt out and not be bound by the arbitration and class action waiver provisions by sending written notice to SoundLine! within thirty (30) days of the effective date of these Terms between Customer and SoundLine!.

In the event that any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and remain enforceable between the parties. No waiver of any provision of these Terms shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such provision or any other provision, and a party’s failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</li><li>Assignment. Neither these Terms nor any of the rights or licenses granted hereunder may be transferred or assigned by either party without the other party’s express prior written consent (not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed); provided, however, that either party may assign these Terms and all order forms related to Customer’s use of the Service upon written notice without the other party’s consent to an affiliate or to its successor in interest in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its assets; provided, however, that should Customer assign these Terms to any direct competitor of SoundLine!, then SoundLine! shall have the right to terminate these Terms and Customer’s use of the Service upon notice, in which case SoundLine! shall provide Customer’s assignee with a pro- rata refund of any prepaid but unused fees. Any other attempt to transfer or assign these Terms or Customer’s subscription to the Service will be null and void.
